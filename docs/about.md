This is a personal blog with stories about my life taking care of my grandmother with dementia. I hope to share my experiences and thoughts with others who are going through similar situations. I also hope to raise awareness about Alzheimer's / dementia and the challenges that come with it.

Memory loss is a difficult thing to deal with, just remember that you are not alone. I hope that my blog can provide some comfort and support to those who need it.
